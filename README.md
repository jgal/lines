The category of this project is Games. Our project will be an online
adaptation of Exquisite Corpse. Exquisite Corpse is an artistic game where
several people contribute sections of a piece of art (ex. poetry, drawings,
stories, etc) and then the sections are put together to form one large
artwork. The users contributing the art are not allowed to see the other
sections until the whole piece is complete. We will host an app that allows 
users to contribute a drawing. The user will be asked to "doodle" a continuing 
line on the app, starting at one point and ending at another. After they submit 
their drawing, they will get to see their drawing put together with all of the 
other drawings that have been collected.

Tools we will be using:

We will be using IMB Bluemix to host our server, and we will use their
microservice MongoDB as our database to store the collected drawings.
We are planning on using AngularJS as our HTML5 framework.
